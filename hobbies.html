        <p>
            Besides drawing, I have a range of interests that keep me creatively engaged. I love exploring new art techniques and styles. Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into watercolor painting and digital art. Each medium offers unique challenges and opportunities for growth. Additionally, I enjoy visiting art galleries and museums to gain new perspectives and ideas. Music is another passion of mine; it often inspires my artwork and helps me get into the creative zone. I also spend time reading art books and following contemporary artists to stay updated with current trends.
